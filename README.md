## Features

### Welcome section

The welcome section provides the user with a brief background on the quiz, and an explanation of the quiz rules. A call to action button is displayed as the bottom the welcome section. When the user clicks this button, the quiz will begin.

### Game section

The game section is the main content of the quiz. Here the user is presented with a randomly picked question and four possible answers. Once the user has made a choice, the correct answer will highlight green, while the incorrect answers will highlight red.

Two counters are also displayed here. One counter tracks the current question index, while the other counter keeps track of amount of questions the user has answered correctly.

If the user wishes to restart the quiz at any point, they can navigate to and click the 'Reset' button. This will take the user back to the welcome section.

### Final score section

The final score section marks the end of the quiz. This section becomes visible to the user once 15 questions have been pulled from the question array. Here the user receives their final score tally that marks the total amount of questions that they have answered correctly.

A call to action button is displayed at the bottom, selecting "Return to start!" button will reload the quiz and return the user to the welcome section.

### Future features to implement
* An audio file that plays when the user selects either the correct, or incorrect answer.
* An option for the user to select the difficulty of the quiz. This will alter both the length of the quiz, and the complexity of the questions.
* An input section for a username. This username would be referenced at different points throughout the quiz.
* Once the user has selected a possible answer, an included Google Maps API would display the location of the item within the correct answer property.
* Toggable background music to accompany the user as they progress throughout the quiz

### Color Scheme
For the color scheme, I opted for a jungle inspired aesthetic that would fit the overall theme of the quiz (discovery/exploration.) The colors within this palette contrast each other well, and also compliment the background image of the quiz.
